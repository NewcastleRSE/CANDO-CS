Module "Pins1"     (component PinSettings)

Module "ALGO"      (component FreeCntr_LDD)
   - ALGO_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - ALGO_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts vectors,
                etc.
   - ALGO_Enable -Enables the component - the internal clocks are counted.
   - ALGO_Disable -Disables the component - the internal clocks are not counted.
   - ALGO_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and if 
                counter is disabled.
   - ALGO_ResetCounter -Resets counter. If counter is counting up then it is set to zero. If counter is counting down then 
                counter is updated to the reload value.   The method is not available if HW doesn't allow resetting of the 
                counter.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

                etc.
   - TU1_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated (see SetEventMask). The 
                method is not available if the counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.

                counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU1_GetEventStatus -Returns current pending flags and clears them.   Note: If corresponding events are generated then 
                these interrupt flags are deleted directly in the ISR. See Properties "Interrupt" and related events.
   - TU1_ResetCounter -Resets counter. If counter is counting up then it is set to zero. If counter is counting down then 
                counter is updated to the reload value.   The method is not available if HW doesn't allow resetting of the 
                counter.
   - TU1_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and if

                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.

                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters.

                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - AS1_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.

                property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

   - DAC_interface_RecvBlock -If any data received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental 
                error), otherwise it returns error code (it does not wait for data).  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination and the ERR_EXEMPTY value is returned.  This method is available only if non-zero length of input 
                buffer is defined.    For information about SW overrun behavior please see <General info page>.
   - DAC_interface_SendBlock -Send a block of characters to the channel. This method is only available if a non-zero length of 
                output buffer is defined.

                disabled, and the Ignore empty character is set to yes, and a character has been received, then this method 
                returns 1 although it was an empty character.
   - DAC_interface_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer.
   - DAC_interface_GetError -Returns a set of errors on the channel (errors that cannot be returned in given methods). The 
                component accumulates errors in a set; after calling [GetError] this set is returned and cleared. This method

   - CANDO3_interface_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel.
   - CANDO3_interface_RecvBlock -If any data received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental 
                error), otherwise it returns error code (it does not wait for data).  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination and the ERR_EXEMPTY value is returned.  This method is available only if non-zero length of input 
                buffer is defined.    For information about SW overrun behavior please see <General info page>.

                disabled, and the Ignore empty character is set to yes, and a character has been received, then this method 
                returns 1 although it was an empty character.
   - CANDO3_interface_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer.
   - CANDO3_interface_GetError -Returns a set of errors on the channel (errors that cannot be returned in given methods). The 
                component accumulates errors in a set; after calling [GetError] this set is returned and cleared. This method 
                is available only if the "Interrupt service/event" property is enabled.
