Flag				Meaning

1  				Start sending data. Ask for packet with algorithm output. 

2				Stop sending data.	

5				Please send version information. (What should be expected back?) 
				Expect string 'RCSbox 2.x' Ascii encoded in bytes. So need to decode into acii and put on the GUI and into the save file.

7 				Update In/Out selection (ASCI/ Microcontroller) 4 bits. Have a default where this 		
				isn't sent and the microcontroller decides. [Not yet implemented in GUI]

10				Update experiment as a whole (expect main parameters packet next, 30 bytes long.)


11				Update parameters/ mode switch. (Expect main parameters packet, but just look at bytes 1, 18-26.) 

200				Force manual reset of the connected microcontroller


Main parameters packet:

Bytes:

1	Manual LED flag, basically ignore the algorithm and just listen to the final three bytes (testing, testing) 1 = manual mode, 0 = algorithm mode

2	binary flag, 1 = set intensity, 0 = phase shift

3	binary flag, 2 = pseudo randomised looping, 1 = sequential, 0 = no loops! (Skip loop code)

4	Kernel length (part 1)

5	Kernel length (part 2)

6	Starting phase condition, degrees (NB: if third byte = 0, so no loop, then this is just the phase.) (byte 1 of 2)

7	Starting phase condition, degrees (NB: if third byte = 0, so no loop, then this is just the phase.) (byte 2 of 2)

8	Step size for looping through phases, degrees (from start: steps : end) If zero there is no loop. Expecting values from 0 - 180.

9 	Final phase condition, degrees(byte 1 of 2)

10 	Final phase condition, degrees(byte 2 of 2)

11	Frequency (Hz)

12	Starting gain condition (NB: if third byte = 0, so no loop, then this is just the gain.)

13	Step size for looping through gain (from start: steps : end) If zero there is no loop.

14 	Final gain condition

15	Starting intensity condition (NB: if third byte = 0, so no loop, then this is just the gain.) If byte 1 = 0, ignore this.

16	Step size for looping through intensity (from start: steps : end) If zero there is no loop. If byte 1 = 0, ignore this.

17	Final intensity condition. If byte 1 = 0, ignore this.

18 	Threshold value (applied post convolution)

19	Time keeping, manual vs. automatic. 1 = automatic (using the next 2 flags), 0 = manual. This is mainly for testing, to allow direct control of the LED.

20	On time (part 1) i.e., the length of time to have the algorithm applied for.

21	On time (part 2)

22	Off time (part 1) i.e., the length of time to have the algorithm turned off for between runs.

23	Off time (part 2)

24	LED level for manual mode (byte 1 of 2)

25 	LED level for manual model (byte 2 of 2)

26	LED on/off in manual mode 1 = ON, 0 = OFF

27-29 	Currently not in use.

30	Flag (this should be 10 or 11 for update parameters)


Update ASIC packet:

Bytes:

1	isASICin boolean 1 for if we are using ASIC input 0 if we are using something else.

2	isASICout boolean 1 for if we are using ASIC output 0 if we are using something else.

3	elec_to_use a value representing what electrode to use, for the ASIC. Values from 1:n, where n is the number of possible electrodes.

4	LEDout a value representing what light output to use, for the ASIC. Values from 1:n where n is the number of possible LED outputs.

5-29	Currently not of use. 

30	Flag - this should be 7.
