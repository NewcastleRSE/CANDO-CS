# CANDO-CS
## Controlling Abnormal Network Dynamics using Optogenetics - Control System ##

This is part of the [CANDO](http://www.cando.ac.uk/) project.

This repository includes source code for the microcontroller and graphical
user interface (GUI) that make up the CANDO-CS device. The CANDO-CS is a stimulation control box
initially developed to apply closed loop optogenetic stimulation in an in vitro
setting, taking an input from an electrode and passing an output based on user
selected stimulation parameters which can be either open or closed loop. 

The microcontroller code has been tested on a FRDM K22F board. The GUI is
written in Matlab and has been tested on mac OSX, Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04
LTS.
